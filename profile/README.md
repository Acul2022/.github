# Work Flow Guidelines
The following work flow guidelines will be used for the projects, the guidelines will be updated as the projects progress.

### Managing tasks
Every component of the **ACUL** application developed must be first broken down into small manageable tasks which should be listed in [JIRA](https://agrimart.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/AGRO/boards/2) under the **To Do** column before they are worked on. 

The tasks can then be moved around throught `in progress` `review` and `done` columns according the their respective statuses.

### Pull request guidelines
- Do no make changes on the main branch directly but instead create another branch based on the main branch and work from there. This reduces the risk of conflicting changes.
- Prefix the branch with you're name, eg. (*godwin/payments-integration*) for easy identification.
- Immediately create a pull request and add the appropriate label (`backend`, `mobile`, `website`, etc.).
- Once you are done with the implementation , add a `READY FOR REVIEW` lable and request a review from a technial person.
- Let one or more techincal people review your code.
- Once the pull request has been approved by a techincal reviewer, add a `READY FOR UAT` lable to be reviwed by the Product lead.
- **Do not merge** any pull request to main before its `UAT` is approved.
- Pull requests from a feature branch may be merged with only the technical review.
- Try to keep the PR as small as possible, if a PR is getting too large, it's a sign that it shoud be broken down into smaller ones.

## Feature branch
### What is a feature branch?
A feature branch is a copy of the main codebase where an individual or team of software developers can work on a new feature until it is complete.

With many developers working in the same code-base, it's important to have a strategy for how individuals work together. To avoid overriding each other's changes, we'll use feature branches.

### Handling issues
When you come accross a bug that need to be fixed, follow these steps:
- Open an issue 
- Add a clear description of the issue
- Provide steps to rep-produce it
- Provide screenshots if necessary

If the issue is small and you can solve it, it's okay to create a pull request straight away and request for a review.

## Communication
All communication about the project should be done in Jira and we should try as much as possible to communicate throught the public channels rather than in the DMs in order to keep everyone informed.

## Daily standup updates
Every mornigng we'll be receiving automated checkin questions about our tasks. These will help us keep track of our daily taks and determine progress so we should try as much as possible to aswer them.
